# Heart-Disease-Analysis-Using-sklearn
Project Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, making early detection and analysis critical for effective treatment and prevention. This project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns and predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various features such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.

The main objectives are:

Data preprocessing and visualization to understand feature relationships.
Training and evaluating classification models.
Optimizing models for better performance using techniques like hyperparameter tuning.
Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes relationships between features using plots and heatmaps.
Model Training: Implements multiple classifiers, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Model Evaluation: Measures performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Deployment Ready: The model can be integrated into applications for real-world predictions.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains patient data related to heart health. Each row represents an individual, and the columns include:

Age
Sex
Blood Pressure
Cholesterol Levels
Fasting Blood Sugar
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
Target (1 = Heart Disease, 0 = No Heart Disease)
Source: The dataset is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash

Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Open heart_disease_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or any IDE like JupyterLab.
Follow the steps in the notebook to explore the dataset, train models, and evaluate performance.
Train and Evaluate:

Choose different classifiers from scikit-learn and compare their performance metrics.
Visualizations:

Use the provided visualizations to understand feature importance and relationships.
Model Evaluation
The project evaluates models using:

Confusion Matrix: To visualize true positives, false positives, etc.
Classification Report: Includes precision, recall, F1-score, and support.
ROC-AUC Curve: Measures the area under the curve for model comparison.
Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of XX% with a high ROC-AUC score of XX%.
